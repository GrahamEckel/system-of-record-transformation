# System of Record Transformation (Sort)
SoRt handles the prioritizing, sorting, merging, and deduplication of columns, rows and individual cells of data based on business-defined logic. I have tested it on Static and Master data with minimal performance issues. However, there are outstanding performance issues when tested on high dimensional transaction data. I consider SoRT a 'small data' BI/ETL solution.
